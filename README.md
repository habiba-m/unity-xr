## Summary

This project is a simple Flask-based server that handles file uploads, specifically for CSV files. It allows users to upload multiple CSV files at once, with checks for file size limitations. Additionally, the server is integrated with Unity.

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

**CSV File Upload**
